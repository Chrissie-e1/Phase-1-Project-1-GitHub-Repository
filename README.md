# Movie Review Analysis
As part of my task, I am researching the  leading studios to understand which industry leaders are present that can help manifest Microsofts ambitions. The purpose of this research is to provide recommendations to Microsoft regarding the types of movies they can produce with their new production studio.

## Summary
The process of anayisis that I adopted is (in order):
- Import the files and relevant libraries and make them workable, i.e decompressing them,
- Clean the data,
- Divide the data into foreign and domestic, conducting my analysis from top and bottom to see the best performing movies,
- Carry out a visual analysis of the studios associated with the best performing films with certain factors under considerations such as years released,
- Form my recommendations as I undergo this anaysis,
- Provide a summary of all recommendations presented throughout the analysis for easier access as a concise conclusion.


## Problem Statement
PROBLEM: EXPLORING THE TYPES OF FILMS AND STUDIOS DOING THE BEST AT THE BOX OFFICE TO BUILD SUGGESTIONS FOR MICROSOFTS ENTRY INTO FILM.

## Data
I engaged with the bom data frame which included:
- Studio
- Title
- Domestic Gross
- Foreign Gross
- Years
The data set is very large with outliers, empty values, and so forth. My task is to clean and organize broad data sets with incomplete information, to gain insights into the movie industry. The goal is to provide Microsoft with informed recommendations that can shape their strategy and decision-making. 
For this project, I will be using the following data from bom:
- Studio
- Title
- Domestic Gross
- Foreign Gross
I worked to enrich my exploration through engaging in webscrapping with the BOM site to gather data on:
- Genre
- Total Gross
- Titles
- 1# Title of Films


## Focus
BOM: I used the bottom and top ten from domestic and foreign gross to help form the bases of my recommendations. I also collected data on the top genres. I will then collect the top ten earning studios overall to examine the validity and strength of my recommendations (to show which studios earned the most domestically and locally). 

## Findings/Observations
- Prior to cleaning, there were dramatic outliers in the data,
- The top film as visualy presented above is 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', followed by 'Black Panther' and 'Avengers: Infinity War'.
- BV has been responsible for two of the lowest performing films domestically in more recent times. Compared to its highest performing representation (seen under Visualization 1), this dip isn't significant enough to be a cause of concern regarding the potential outcomes of a partnership with BV. This is because, comparatively, the dips in performance are blindingly outshined by their consistency throughout the years in outranking the performance of their competitors on a domestic scale.
- The top three grossing films on an international scale are 'Iron Man 3', followed by 'Aquaman', then the 'Minions'.
- An animation film on penguins (Madagascar) is the highest grossing genre according to the data collected.


## Recommendations 
- The common theme between the top three movies is that they were produced by studio BV. This studio as viewed above in Visualization 2 takes the chunk of the pie when it comes to the amount of gross profit earned on a domestic level- it has contributed to the most top grossing domestic films overall. Therefore, it is recommended that Microsoft engages with the studio in order to be able to engage with proffessionals that have been able to successfully cater to the needs of the viewers. This will not only help Microsoft gain credibility by means of proffessional association with studios that are able to achieve such milestones, but also gain access to the market that it has been able to pierce.
Additionally, a partnership or engagement with LG/S for domestic film releases and creation is highly discouraged due to its poor overall performance domestically. It presents itself as a high risk and very low return opportunity.
- It is highly encouraged for Microsoft to engage with BV if it intends to engage with the domestic film market successfully.

- Compared to what we had seen under the domestic analysis, there is a clear trend that can be observed here. BV as seen above brings in the most profit again but on an international scale. Therefore, to pair with the previous recommendation, it is encouraged for Microsoft to not only pair with BV for domestically released and advertised films but also films that are intended to feed into the international market. As seen in both points of analysis, BV yields the most amount of profit, therefore it can be boldly predicted that Microsoft may experience very amicable returns on both domestic and international fronts following a partnership for film making.

- Additionally, a partnership for the creation and engagement of film intended for an international audience in general is strongly discouraged as it pertains to the following studios:
LG/S
Sum.
WB (NL)
WGUSA

This is because these studios yield very low returns and in general don't perform well on an international platform. Engagement with the mentioned may prove to harm the potential for success that Microsoft envisioned during the conception of its ambition to engage with the film industry.
Recognizing the analysis done in the previous bubble graph, it is also encouraged for Microsoft to focus on building its international profile. This is because overally, foreign films (grossing at 18652000000) have been observe to have performed much better at the box office than domestic films (grossing at 11321500000). The international market boasts a very appealing opportunity for Microsofts growth in film.

- According to the information gathered here and above, it is clear that animation films are popular (minions, penguins of madagascar, toy story 3, Coco, etc) followed by Adventure/Action films such as Jaws, Gone with the wond, Avatar, Jurassic World,etc. Therefore, it is recommended for Microsoft to invest in these films in order to appeal to the interests of the market as they are the most in demand and highest grossing genres according to the diverse data engaged with in this analysis.
